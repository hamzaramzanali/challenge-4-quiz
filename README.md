# challenge-4-quiz
This challenge was to make a quiz with a timer. The quiz was supposed to be about coding. The timer should remove time if the person gets the question wrong. The timer should add time if the person gets the question right. In the end, the user should be able to store their score to see how they did. Unfortunately, I was unable to get my code to work because I was not sure how to do this project. I added a timer and that was it, but was unable to make the quiz start.
